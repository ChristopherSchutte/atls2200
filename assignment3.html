          Ice cream is a sweetened frozen <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food">food</a> typically eaten as a snack or dessert. It may be made from milk or cream and is flavoured with a sweetener, either sugar or an alternative, and a spice, such as cocoa or vanilla, or with
            fruit such as strawberries or peaches. It can also be made by whisking a flavored cream base and liquid nitrogen together. Food coloring is sometimes added, in addition to stabilizers. The mixture is cooled below the freezing
            point of water and stirred to incorporate air spaces and to prevent detectable ice crystals from forming. The result is a smooth, semi-solid foam that is solid at very low temperatures (below 2 °C or 35 °F). It becomes more
            malleable as its temperature increases.
        </p>
        <p>The meaning of the name "ice cream" varies from one country to another.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ice cream and gelato, based on cream and milk.</li>
            <li>Frozen yogurt, based on yogurt or kefir.</li>
            <li>Ice milk.</li>
            <li>orbet/slushy, ice pop/popsicle/icicle: Water base. Examples: frozen cola, frozen lemonade, frozen tea.</li>
            <li>Sherbet, like sorbet but with some milk added.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In some countries, such as the United States, "ice cream" applies only to a specific variety, and most governments regulate the commercial use of the various terms according to the relative quantities of the main ingredients,
            notably the amount of cream.[1] Products that do not meet the criteria to be called ice cream are sometimes labelled "frozen dairy dessert" instead.[2] In other countries, such as Italy and Argentina, one word is used for all
            variants. Analogues made from dairy alternatives, such as goat's or sheep's milk, or milk substitutes (e.g., soy, cashew, coconut, almond milk or tofu), are available for those who are lactose intolerant, allergic to dairy
            protein, or vegan.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ice cream may be served in dishes, for eating with a spoon, or licked from edible wafer cones. Ice cream may be served with other desserts, such as apple pie, or as an ingredient in ice cream floats, sundaes, milkshakes, ice
            cream cakes and even baked items, such as Baked Alaska.

            The origins of frozen desserts are obscure although several accounts exist about their history. Some sources describe ice cream-like foods as originating in Persia as far back as 550 BCE[3][4] while others claim that the Roman
            Emperor Nero had ice collected from the Apennine Mountains to produce the first sorbet mixed with honey and wine. Although sorbets are believed to have been invented in Persia,[5][4][6][7][8] other accounts say ice cream
            originated in the Mongol Empire and first spread to China during its expansion.[9]

        <p>
            Its spread throughout Europe is sometimes attributed to Arab traders, but more often to Marco Polo. Though it's not mentioned in any of his writings, Polo is often credited with introducing sorbet-style desserts to Italy after
            learning of it during his travels to China.[8][7][10] The Italian duchess Catherine de' Medici is said to have introduced flavored sorbet ices to France when she brought some Italian chefs with her to France upon marrying the
            Duke of Orléans (Henry II of France) in 1533.[11][8] One hundred years later, Charles I of England was reportedly so impressed by the "frozen snow" that he offered his own ice cream maker a lifetime pension in return for keeping
            the formula secret, so that ice cream could be a royal prerogative.[12] There is no evidence to support any of these legends.[7][9]

            Snow was used to cool drinks in Greece around 500 BC and Hippocrates is known to have criticized chilled drinks for causing "fluxes of the stomach".[10] Snow collected from the lower slopes of mountains was unsanitary and iced
            drinks were believed to cause convulsions, colic and a host of other ailments.[13][7] Seneca criticized the extravagant costs associated with iced desserts in an era without refrigeration.[10]
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite this, ice and snow were prized ingredients in ancient cuisines including Japanese, Chinese, Greek and Roman cuisines.[13] Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs show a snow-filled vessel next to fruit juice.[8] There are Tang
            dynasty records of a chilled dessert made with flour, camphor and water buffalo milk and recipes for snow-chilled sweets are included in a 1st-century Roman recipe book. There are Persian records from the 2nd century AD for
            sweetened chilled drinks with ice made by freezing water in the desert at night.[9]

            Ice cream was made possible only by the discovery of the endothermic effect. Prior to this, cream could only be chilled but not frozen. It was the addition of salt, that lowered the melting point of ice, which had the effect of
            drawing heat from the cream and allowing it to freeze. The first known record of this comes from the Indian poem Pancatantra, dating to the 4th century AD.[8] The earliest written description of the process is known not from
            culinary texts, but the 13th-century writings of Ibn Abu Usaybia concerning medicine. The technique of "freezing" is not known from any European sources prior to the 16th century.[13]
